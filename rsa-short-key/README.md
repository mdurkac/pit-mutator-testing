# Demonstration of `RSA_WITH_SHORT_KEY_MUTATOR` mutator

## Use RSA with short key (URSAWSK)

Goal: the `URSAWSK` operator tries to weaken RSA encryption to make brute force attacks possible, allowing confidential data to leak. 

Implementation: it detects the use of RSA encryption with a sufficient key size and sets its to 512 bits.

## Content

Project contains an example of a test that on its own kills the mutator and a test that on its own does not kill the mutator.
