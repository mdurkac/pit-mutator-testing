# Demonstration of `REMOVE_SECURE_FLAG_MUTATOR` mutator

## Unsecure cookie (UC)

Goal: the `UC` operator allows to send sensitive cookies during unsecured HTTP communication. 

Implementation: it removes the call to the methods setting the secure flag on cookies.

## Content

Project contains an example of a test that on its own kills the mutator and a test that on its own does not kill the mutator.
