# Demonstration of `TRUST_USER_INPUT_IN_FILES_RETRIEVEMENT` mutator

## Remove path traversal sanitization (RPTS)

Goal: the `RPTS` operator introduces a vulnerability which allows a malicious user to enter a path to access directories or files regardless of the file access policy defined by the web application. 

Implementation: the operator simply removes calls to input file names sanitization functions, generally used to avoid this vulnerability.

## Content

Project contains an example of a test that on its own kills the mutator and a test that on its own does not kill the mutator.
